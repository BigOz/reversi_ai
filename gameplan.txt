MOTIVATION
To train a program to play the game of reversi using various techniques,
including reinforcement learning, monte carlo tree search, neural networks, and q-learning (value iteration?)

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
The program will not need to know the rules of reversi.  It will learn
entirely from supervised and unsupervised machine learning, plus reinforcement.

MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH
One version will utilize the MCTS technique. Note that MCTS isn't necessarily
machine learning, since every move is determined live based on random playthroughs
from each state of the game.  This is where the difference between "AI" and "Machine learning"
becomes apparent.  This is AI.

Q-LEARNING
This is machine learning.  The game will train against itself.

We will implement monte carlo tree search first. 

1. mcts. NOT machine learning.
2. q-learning. this IS machine learning.  do it with value iteration.
3. q-learning but with neural network.
